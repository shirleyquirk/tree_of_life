Look in NETLIB under random for dcdflib.c.  This has CDF's and inverse CDF's
for many functions.  The file is called a tar, but it is really a gz.  So
you must rename it before you can open it.  Well documented and complies
easily under gcc or VC.
Example Netlib Search at URL http://www.netlib.org/utk/misc/netlib_query.html
and in the search box enter "complementary incomplete gamma" 
(including the quotation marks).

Just get AS 66 for the normal distribution function, and AS 241 for its
inverse.  The Applied Statistics algorithms were published by the
Royal Statistical Society.  They can be downloaded from statlib
(http://lib.stat.cmu.edu).  They are both in Fortran, though some of the
RSS algorithms were in Algol and Pascal, and one was in C.

Gamma:
Stephen L. Moshier wins the prize.  He has the gamma function written at
hardware precisions from float to double to 80 bit long double and 128 bit
long double as well as an extended precision version called qfloat.  It's at
Netlib, in the Cephes collection.  Have fun.
