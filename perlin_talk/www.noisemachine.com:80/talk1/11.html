It has always seemed to me that there would be advantages
in having optical materials with continually
varying density, within which light travels
in curved paths.
The image on the left is a hypertexture experiment
in continuous refraction.
The object is transparent, and every point on its
interior has a different index of refraction.
I implemented a volumetric version of Snell's law,
to trace the curved paths made by light as it
traveled through the object's interior.
<p>
The background is not really an out-of-focus
scene; it's just low frequency noise added to
a color grad.
This is a situation in which noise is really
convenient - to give that look of
"there's something in background, and I don't
know what it is, but it looks reasonable and it sure is out of focus."
