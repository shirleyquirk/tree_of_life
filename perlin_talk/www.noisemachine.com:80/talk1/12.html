Meanwhile, back at the Ranch (if you're reading this you presumably know <i>which</i>
ranch I'm talking about)
the use of noise spread like wildfire.
All the James Cameron, Schwartzenegger, Star Trek, Batman,
etc. movies started relying on it.

<p>
Noise benefits from Moore's law:
as computer CPU time becomes cheaper,
production companies increasingly have
turned away from physical models, and
toward computer graphics.
Noise is one of the main techniques production companies use to
fool audiences into thinking that computer
graphic models have the subtle irregularities of real objects.

<p>
Disney put it into their CAPS system -
you can see it in the mists and layered atmosphere
in high end animated features like The Lion King.

<p>
In fact, after around 1990 or so, <i>every</i>
Hollywood effects film has used it, since they all
make use of software shaders, and software
shaders depend heavily on noise.
Which is why I have finally gotten around
to giving an up-to-date talk
on how it works.
