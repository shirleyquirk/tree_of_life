I first started to think seriously about
procedural textures when I was working on TRON
at MAGI in Elmsford, NY, in 1981.
TRON was the first movie with a large amount
of solid shaded computer graphics.
This made it revolutionary.
On the other hand, the look designed
for it by its creator Steven Lisberger
was based around the known
limitations of the technology.
<p>
Lisberger had gotten the idea for TRON
after seeing the MAGI demo reel in 1978.
He then approached the Walt Disney Company
with his concept.  Disney's Feature Film
division was then under the visionary
guidance of Tom Wilhite,
who arranged for contributions from the various computer graphics
companies of the day,
including III, MAGI, and Digital Effects.
<p>
Working on TRON was a blast, but on some level I was frustrated
by the fact that everything looked machine-like.
In fact, that became the "look" associated with MAGI
in the wake of TRON.
So I got to work trying to help us break out of
the "machine-look ghetto."
