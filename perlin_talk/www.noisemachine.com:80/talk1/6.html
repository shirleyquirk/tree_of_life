The first thing I did in 1983 was to create
a primitive space-filling signal that
would give an impression of randomness.
It needed to have variation that looked random,
and yet it needed to be controllable,
so it could be used to design various looks.
I set about designing a primitive
that would be "random" but with all its
visual features roughly the same size
(no high or low spatial frequencies).
<p>
I ended up developing a simple pseudo-random "noise"
function that fills all of three dimensional space.  A slice out of
this stuff is pictured to the left.
In order to make it controllable, the important
thing is that all the apparently random variations
be the same size and roughly isotropic.
Ideally, you want to be able to do arbitrary
translations and rotations without changing its appearance too much.
You can find my original 1983 code for the first
version

<p>
My goal was to be able to use this function
in functional expressions to make natural looking textures.
I gave it a range of -1 to +1 (like sine and cosine)
so that is would have a dc component of zero.
This would make it easy to use noise to perturb things, and just
"fuzz out" to zero when scaled to be small.
