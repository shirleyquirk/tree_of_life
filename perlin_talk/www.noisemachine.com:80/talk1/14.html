Noise appears random, but isn't really.
If it were really random, then you'd get a
different result every time you call it.
Instead, it's "pseudo-random" - it gives
the <i>appearance</i> of randomness.
<p>
Noise is a mapping from R<sup>n</sup> to R -
you input an n-dimensional point with real coordinates,
and it returns a real value.
Currently the most common uses are
for n=1, n=2, and n=3.
The first is used for animation,
the second for cheap texture hacks,
and the third for less-cheap texture hacks.
Noise over R<sup>4</sup> is also very useful
for time-varying solid textures, as I'll show later.
<p>
Noise is <i>band-limited</i> - almost all of its energy
(when looked at as a signal)
is concentrated in a small part of the frequency
spectrum.  High frequencies (visually small details)
and low frequencies (large shapes) contribute very little
energy.
Its appearance is similar to what you'd get if
you took a big block of random values and blurred it
(ie: convolved with a gaussian kernel).
Although that would be quite expensive to compute.
<p>
To make noise run fast, I implement it as a pseudo-random
spline on a regular grid.  Now we'll examine this
fast implementation in some detail.
