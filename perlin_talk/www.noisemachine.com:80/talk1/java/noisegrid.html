Constructing 2D noise

The diagram on the left goes step by step
through the construction of 2D noise.
The point being evaluated is shown in red.
<p>
Try clicking on the diagram.
First you will see a linear gradient
rising from one of the four surrounding grid points.
This is the pseudo-random gradient the algorithm
has chosen at that point.
<p>
Click again, and you will see the drop-off filter centered
at that grid point.
This filter, which makes the influence of this grid point
gradually drop to zero at a unit distance,
is a product of two
cubic drop-off curves, one in x and the other in y.
The shape of each cubic is computed by 3t<sup>2</sup>-2t<sup>3</sup>.
<p>
Click again, and
you will see the the linear gradient multiplied by
the weighting filter.  This will be the contribution from
that grid point to the final result.

<p>
Click three more times.
You will see, in turn, the contributions from each of the other three surrounding grid points.
<p>

Finally, click one more time, and you will see the final result -
the sum of the contributions from the four surrounding grid points.
