One of the factors that influenced me was the
fact that MAGI SynthaVision did not use polygons.
Rather, everything was built from boolean combinations of mathematical primitives,
such as
ellipsoids, cylinders, truncated cones.
As you can see in the illustration on the left,
the lightcycles are created by adding and subtracting
simple solid mathematical shapes.
<p>
This encouraged me to think of texturing in terms
not of surfaces, but of volumes.
First I developed what are now called "projection textures,"
which were also independently developed by a quite a few folks.
Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it)
our Perkin-Elmer and Gould SEL computers, while extremely fast for the time,
had very little RAM,
so we couldn't fit detailed texture images into memory.
I started to look for other approaches.
