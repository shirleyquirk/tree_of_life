<h2>Rappin' Noise</h2>
<p>
<i>(the version I gave on Friday, July 6, 2002)</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>I was hangin' at MAGI finishin' TRON
<br>Lookin' for somethin' def to be workin' on
<br>So I sez to my posse, I sez to my Boyz
<br>"Comin' right at ya, gonna make some Noise."
<p>
<br>I made it stochastic, I made it 3-D
<br>I was rappin' solid textures with no U,V
<br>Workin' in the Lab till the Sun don't shine
<br>On a smooth interpolation and a 3-D spline.
<p>
<br>That's how it started, I'm HALF way through
<br>Now I'm comin' at ya with the big Part Two.
<p>
<br>Noise was fine, it was solid, I LIKED what I did
<br>But what did I know?  I was just a kid.
<br>Now I'm older and badder, and I got the groove,
<br>Got no one to beat, got nothin' to prove.
<p>
<br>New Noise looks betta, even betta than fine
<br>With a new interpolation and a WHOLE new spline.
<br>Now Noise looks fresh and I'm feelin' hot
<br>A paper in SIGGRAPH, that's what I got.
<p>
<br>Well that's de dope, welcome to MY day,
<br>And ya gonna hear more, cause now it's Fri-day
